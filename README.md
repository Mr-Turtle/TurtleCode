# TurtleCode
Turtle Code is a small IDE written by me, Mr Turtle. You can use it if you want. Currently it is launched in light-mode, but a dark-mode is available by changing "default_style" in config.json to "dark". Dark-mode would be the default, however due to complications with the worst python package in the world: Tkinter.ttk, the project view's colour cannot be changed.

# PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A NEW FILE AS IT WILL OVERWRITE THE PREVIOUS FILE.
