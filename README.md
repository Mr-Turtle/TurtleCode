# TurtleCode
Turtle Code is a small IDE written by me, Mr Turtle. You can use it if you want. Currently it is launched in light-mode, but a dark-mode is available by changing "default_style" in config.json to "dark". Dark-mode would be the default, however due to complications with the worst python package in the world: Tkinter.ttk, the project view's colour cannot be changed.

## Keybinds
- Ctrl + S -> Save
- Ctrl + Shift + S -> Save as
- Ctrl + O -> Open
- Ctrl + Shift + O -> Open folder as project
- Ctrl + R -> Run current file according to the "default_run_command" in the language folder of the current language.
- Shift + Tab -> Insert first word in auto-fill list (Right-side)
